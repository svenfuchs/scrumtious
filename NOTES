convert hours to minutes
make ticket lists filterable

make sprints not belong_to a release?
  » this would mean that a sprint can not be sync'ed up to lighthouse anymore easily
    it could be "split" up and sync'ed to all projects it contains tickets from

make it possible to compose a sprint from multiple projects
rake task for regularly synch'ing from lighthouse




convert everything to use minutes then use a helper in views: <%= hrs ticket.estimated %>

spec everything about syncs

Ticket#lighthouse_url » helper
Ticket#number_and_title » helper

rename category to bin (?)
make modules nested_sets (?)
