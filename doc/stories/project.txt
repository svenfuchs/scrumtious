As a product manager
I want to create a project
So I can plan it with my team

A scrumtious project maps to a Lighthouse project. To access Lighthouse the scrumtious project needs to know the Lighthouse project id and token.

A scrumtious project has two types of milestones: releases and sprints. Sprints belong to releases. 

When a scrumtious project pulls from Lighthouse 

* it locally creates milestones that are present on Lighthouse. 
* Doing so it first creates releases and then milestones. 
* For releases it looks for LH milestones whose titles match the release title pattern (/Release .*/ by default)
* For sprints it looks for LH milestones whose titles match the sprint title pattern (/Sprint .*/ by default)
* When a sprint is pulled from LH scrumtious looks for the release with the closest due date after the sprint's due date. When no release is found that has a due date after the sprint's due date it does not assign the sprint to a release.

When a release or sprint is created locally scrumtious looks if a corresponding milestone already exists on Lighthouse and creates it otherwise.
